This is a subset of a larger dataset with roughly 22,000 objects plus procedural generation code.

The garment objects were simplified using Blender script from 10,000+ vertices to 200 ~ 2,000 vertices. The blender script is located at 'scripts/blender_sewing_dataset_decimation.py'

Please refer to the Wiki on the repo page for instructions to use the blender script.
